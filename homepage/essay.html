                I’d be surprised if I heard a fellow New Yorker tell me that they never heard of Jackson Heights, or how MTA stations like to call it “74th street, Roosevelt Avenue.” I can say for a fact that if you are from Queens you have definitely been to Jackson Heights at least once in your life, and if you haven’t it's pretty obvious that you live under a rock.

              Among these cultural groups, the people of the Tibetan community are very visible. It is also the community that I am a part of. From a young age, my parents would speak to me in the language, but as I started to grow older they became worried that it may affect my English in school, so they stopped. However, I was able to fully understand both languages, since I was used to hearing them communicate with one another. From a young age, my parents and I would often go to Jackson Heights, whether it was to meet a friend, attend a cultural gathering, participate in other traditional celebrations, or to just eat. It was a place where I could connect with my Tibetan heritage and learn more about my culture.

              At a certain point, my mother was concerned that I would grow up not knowing anything about my culture and roots, so she talked to some of her friends about it. They recommended her a Sunday school in Jackson Heights, which taught children how to read, write and speak in Tibetan. They even offered traditional Tibetan dances lessons, but I wasn’t planning on embarrassing myself and creating a bad first impression. After all, I needed to make some friends.

              On the first day, I was alone and felt like an outsider. I didn’t know anybody and I could barely understand the teachers, since they couldn’t speak English. Then a girl with a beautiful pink sweater and blue framed glasses approached me and asked what my name was. I told her that it was Tenzing and she replied “me too.” Of course, I wasn’t too surprised, since I knew that in Tibetan culture sharing that name was common, but I wasn’t expecting to hear that at the moment. From that moment on, we connected right away and were always together. She then introduced me to the rest of her friends, and I was able to grow more connections and meet new people. The next day we were taught how to read the Tibetan alphabet, then how to perform a Tibetan dance. We were told that we would be performing the dances at a special city council event, which made me nervous because I can’t dance and I never had. However, I told myself to calm down and just try my best because I wanted to make my parents proud.

              About six months later, we had already rehearsed three different dances and now we had to perform for the city council. It was supposed to be a big event held in Jackson Heights, which shows the different Tibetan cultural dances and performances. I was scared because I was so used to being the person watching and enjoying these events, but now I was an actual performer in it. The moment I got on the stage, I could feel my stomach churn and my palms starting to sweat. I could see my parents and teachers below, I could see my friends beside me getting ready, and I could see the view of Jackson Heights - the neighborhood that I loved the most. I suddenly didn’t feel as nervous, but instead felt more confident in myself. After the performance, I could see people cheering, clapping, and smiling. I felt proud of myself and loved being able to represent my culture with this diverse neighborhood. It has become a place that helped me to grow and become the person I am today. Jackson Heights is a place where all people can connect with one another due to the appreciation, representation, and influence of diverse cultures and traditions.
